# mini-java-compiler

This is a compiler written for the subset of the Java Language.
The course, as far as I know, is still ongoing, so I will keep 
this repo purposefully inaccesssable to the degree I can. If you
are taking this class and found your way here, congratulations. 
The specification this language was based off of can be found here:

## How to build the compiler:

1. cd into the mini-java-compiler directory

2. run `make`

## How to run the compiler

1. Download Jasmin, the Java Bytecode Generator.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasmin/files/

From the Jasmin homepage:
"Jasmin is an assembler for the Java Virtual Machine. 
It takes ASCII descriptions of Java classes, written 
in a simple assembler-like syntax using the Java Virtual 
Machine instruction set. It converts them into binary 
Java class files, suitable for loading by a Java runtime system.

2. Place jasmin.jar into the src folder

## Usage:

`./emjc <source_file>`

## Optimization 

The implemented optimization is a simple dead code removal. It scans the code
for instances where a variable is defined, but then never used in any expression
or other definition. They are optimized away, ensuring that no code is
generated by those statements. It works particularly well when there is dead
definitions that invoke multiple arithmetic operators.
